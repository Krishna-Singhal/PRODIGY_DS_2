# Task - 2

# Data Cleaning & Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Overview

This project focuses on performing data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset from Kaggle. The goal is to explore the relationships between variables, identify patterns and trends, and gain insights into the factors influencing survival rates.

The project was developed with the assistance of Prodigy Infotech and aims to provide an intuitive and insightful analysis of the Titanic dataset.

## Features

- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies to ensure a clean dataset for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing and analyzing the relationships between different variables, such as gender, age, and passenger class, to uncover trends and patterns.
- **Survival Analysis**: Investigating the factors that influenced survival on the Titanic, including socio-economic status, gender, and age.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas, Numpy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
